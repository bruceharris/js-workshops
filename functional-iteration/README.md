# JavaScript Functional Iteration Workshop

## Agenda

This workshop will cover functional iteration, filtering, and aggregation over arrays using `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.forEach()`, and `.reduce()`

## Prerequisites

To benefit from this workshop, you should already be comfortable with the following JavaScript basics...

* How arrays are defined and how their elements are accessed
* How to loop through the elements of an array with a `for` loop
* What an object is and how object literals are defined and their properties are accessed
* What a function is and how functions are defined

## Format

This repo has tags that correspond to the successive steps of the exercises we will cover. Step 1 is tag `s1`, step 2 is `s2`, and so on (through step 7). Each step has an exercise that you will solve.

In it's current state, the solutions have been implemented, so refrain from looking at the source of `index.js` if you don't want to cheat.

## Instructions

1. Open your command line terminal 
2. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/bruceharris/js-workshops.git`
3. `cd functional-iteration`
4. `npm i` (short for `npm install`) to download dependencies
5. To rewind to exercise #1 (step 1), `git checkout s1`
6. Open `index.js` in a text editor, where you will have a task to complete.
7. On the commmand line, `npm test` to run the tests (in `test.js`), you should see 1 test passing
8. Your task is to modify the code to use a functional style, without breaking the tests.
9. After modifying your code, run the tests to ensure they are still passing.
10. After successfully completing exercise 1, `git stash` to save the current state of your work
11. `git checkout s2` to proceed to step 2
12. Repeat the above through step 7 (s7)

Step 6 is the final exercise step, and step 7 demonstrates a solution to the problem posed in step 6.
