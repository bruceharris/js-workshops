# JavaScript Functional Iteration Workshop

## Agenda

This workshop will cover functional iteration, filtering, and aggregation over arrays using `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.forEach()`, and `.reduce()`

## Prerequisites

To benefit from this workshop, you should already be comfortable with the following JavaScript basics...

* How arrays are defined and how their elements are accessed
* How to loop through the elements of an array with a `for` loop
* What an object is and how object literals are defined and their properties are accessed
* What a function is and how functions are defined

## Format

This repo has tags that correspond to the successive steps of the exercises we will cover. Step 1 is tag `s1`, step 2 is `s2`, and so on (through step 7). Each step has an exercise that you will solve.

In it's current state, the solutions have been implemented, so refrain from looking at the source of `index.js` if you don't want to cheat.

## Instructions

1. Open your command line terminal 
2. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/bruceharris/js-workshops.git`
3. `cd functional-iteration`
4. `npm i` (short for `npm install`) to download dependencies

To rewind to step 1, `git checkout s1`

See `index.js`, where you will have a task to complete.

The tests (in `test.js`) will pass initially - your task is to modify the code to use a functional style, without breaking the tests.

To run the tests, `npm test`

To proceed to step 2, `git checkout s2` etc...

Step 6 is the final exercise step, and step 7 demonstrates a solution to the problem posed in step 6.
