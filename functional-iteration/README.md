# JavaScript Functional Iteration Workshop

This workshop will cover functional iteration, filtering, and aggregation over arrays using `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.forEach()`, and `.reduce()`

This repo has tags that correspond to the successive steps of the exercises we will cover. Step 1 is tag `s1`, step 2 is `s2`, and so on (through step 7). Each step has an exercise that you will solve.

In it's current state, the solutions have been implemented, so refrain from looking at the source of `index.js` if you don't want to cheat.

Clone this repo, then `npm i` (short for `npm install`) to download dependencies.

To rewind to step 1, (after cloning this repo) `git checkout s1`

See `index.js`, where you will have a task to complete.

The tests (in `test.js`) will pass initially - your task is to modify the code to use a functional style, without breaking the tests.

To run the tests, `npm test`

To proceed to step 2, `git checkout s2` etc...

Step 6 is the final exercise step, and step 7 demonstrates a solution to the problem posed in step 6.
